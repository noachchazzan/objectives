            <p><strong>Biography: </strong></p>
            <p>
                I am a professional computer programmer and former sales man in finance and technology. 
                My areas of interest and expertise are in Javascript, MERN/MEAN stack programming, SQL, noSQL, 
                Linux operating systems, React.js, backend programming and application of data structures and 
                algorithms. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Master's degree in Economics.
                I am Tevin Carter and I grew up in NJ. I reside in New Jersey and ever since I was a child I 
                was interested in computers and programming. I programmed my first computer when I was 8 and I went to Passaic Valley Regional High School in 
                Little Falls, New Jersey. I went on to study Computer Science and Economics in New Jersey at the University of Rutgers. I then went on to pursue a 
                career in sales and then became a stock broker but then when COVID-19 hit I decided it was time for a career change. I began selling MCA loans and updating 
                my skill set eventually after much study I was able to complete a bootcamp at AppAcademy then I went onto Perscholas and now 
                I work full time as a software engineer.
