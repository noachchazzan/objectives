Strengths:

1. Security: The requirement for both parties to be physically present can reduce fraud.
2. Real-world Integration: It mimics cash transactions where both parties need to be present.
3. Flexibility: Users can set up their own transaction rules, allowing for adaptability to various situations.

Considerations:

1. Privacy: Ensure that user locations are not tracked beyond what's necessary for the transaction. Users should be aware of when and how their location is being accessed.
2. Usability: The process should be seamless. Too many steps might deter users. Consider using NFC or Bluetooth technology for proximity detection.
3. Fallback: There should be a mechanism for disputes or if the transaction doesn't go as planned. E.g., if one party doesn't show up or if there's a disagreement about the transaction.
4. Safety: Meeting strangers for transactions can have risks. Consider integrating safety tips or even a panic button that alerts local authorities.
5. Offline Transactions: Consider how the app would handle situations where the user might be offline or in areas with poor internet connectivity.
6. Regulations: Given that this involves financial transactions, ensure that you're compliant with local and international financial regulation. 
 Features to Consider:

1. Ratings & Reviews: Allow users to rate and review each other after a transaction. This can help build trust within the community.
2. Transaction History: Allow users to view past transactions, which can be essential for record-keeping.
3. Notifications: Notify users as the transaction time approaches or if there are any changes.
4. Chat: Integrate a chat system for users to communicate and discuss transaction details securely.

Technical Aspects:
`
1. Backend: Securely handle transactions and store user data. Consider using technologies like Node.js with Express for the server and MongoDB for the database.
2. Frontend: Ensure a responsive design for both web and mobile. Using React can help in creating a seamless user experience.
3. APIs: Y`ou'll need to integrate with bank APIs or payment gateway APIs to handle the actual money transfer.
4. Proximity Detection: As mentioned, consider NFC, Bluetooth, or even QR codes for proximity detection and validation.

In conclusion, while the concept is intriguing, it requires meticulous planning and attention to detail, especially given the financial and safety aspects involved.

There are 3 pages here. The first page is supposed to be a landing/home page that contains information about the websites 
and advertising it's merits. From there then the user can choose to either sign up, click the user icon/link in the navbar or click the sign in 
button to goto the user page. The User page is the dashboard technically and the sign up page is a page with a form to sign up. This project
uses several animations, css inline/enternal/style in the head, has many html elements and uses media queries for more responsive design. The 
nav bar is there but not fully functional because you only wanted 3 pages but you i will link them either to an empty page or google.This 
demostrates nasic use of html/css/bootstrap with respect to the content that was taught to me in weeks 1-2 of this course. It contains images
and a gid image. It should be consistent accross pages. It is nowhere near complete or on my level of standards but it should suffice and if not 
then I understand because I am a perfectionist.
